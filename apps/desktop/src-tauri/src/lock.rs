//! Settings → Sync, when it syncs through UwULock: signing in, signing out,

//! channel.
//!
//! The work is `uwussh_sync::lock`'s; this layer adds what the operating

//! sealed like the UwUSync pairing's secrets, see [`crate::device`]) and the
//! words the page shows. The master password goes into one command and is
