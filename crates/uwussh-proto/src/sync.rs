//! What actually travels between client and server.
//!
//! The server only ever sees an [`Envelope`]: an id, a sequence number, a kind
//! hint and an opaque blob. It cannot read the blob, so everything it does —
//! ordering, paging, conflict detection — has to work on the header alone.
//! That constraint is deliberate, and it is why the cursor is a server sequence
//! number rather than a timestamp the client could lie about.
//!
//! **The header is authenticated too.** `updated_at` and `deleted` go into the
//! associated data of the sealed blob (see `uwussh-vault`), which is what stops
//! a hostile server from marking a record deleted — a tombstone beats a
//! concurrent edit, so that one flipped bit would otherwise remove a host from
//! every device. A tombstone therefore carries a sealed (empty) payload of its
//! own instead of nothing at all.
