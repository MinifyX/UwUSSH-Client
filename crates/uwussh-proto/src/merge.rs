//! Who wins when two devices edited the same record.
//!
//! Last-writer-wins per record, decided by the hybrid logical clock rather than
//! wall time. Per record and not per field: two devices practically never edit
//! the same host at the same moment, and a field-wise merge needs a common
//! ancestor for every field, which costs a second copy of every record for a
//! case that does not happen. Snippet bodies, where text really can collide,
//! are the one place that may earn a three-way merge later.
//!
//! One asymmetry is deliberate: **a delete beats a concurrent edit**. If one
//! device removed a host while another renamed it, resurrecting the host is
//! the worse outcome — the rename is cheap to redo, an unexpectedly returning
//! host you thought you had removed is confusing and, for a bastion you
//! decommissioned, actively wrong.
//!
//! This lives in `uwussh-proto` rather than in the sync engine because both
//! sides of the engine need it: the store applies the decision inside the same
//! transaction that writes the record, and the engine decides what to push.
