//! Manifests on this device: publishing its own, and checking everyone's.
//!
//! The format and the reasoning are in `uwussh_proto::manifest`. What lives
//! here is what the store decides:
//!
//! - **What a manifest lists.** Rows the server has confirmed and nothing has
//!   changed since — `dirty = 0` and a server version — and never a
//!   placeholder. A row changed here but not yet pushed is left out: the
//!   version the server has of it is no longer known here, and listing the
//!   local one would claim something the server never saw.
//! - **What counts as missing.** After a pull that reached the end, every
//!   version a manifest lists must be here, or something newer — a later edit,
//!   or a tombstone, which beats every edit anyway. A listed tombstone for a
//!   record this device never had is fine, and so is a host key that arrived
//!   and gave up its slot to a newer one for the same address (see
//!   `superseded`). Kinds this build keeps no table for are not checked.
//! - **What follows from it.** The last check is written down, and while it
//!   found anything about host keys, a host key that came from another device
//!   is not trusted: `known_host` answers as if the host were new, so the next
//!   connection asks. One the user trusted on this device stays trusted.
