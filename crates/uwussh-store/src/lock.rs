//! Syncing through a UwULock Server instead of UwUSync: what this device
//! keeps of it.
//!
//! On UwULock the vault's key is the key of the account's `ssh` space, and the
//! vault's id is the space's id — so the records are sealed exactly as they
//! are for UwUSync, and only the key comes from somewhere else: the UwULock
//! account, opened with its master password. Joining a space is therefore
//! [`Store::adopt_vault`] with that key, and the vault here is wrapped under
//! the UwULock master password, so one password opens both.
//!
//! What is kept besides: the server, the email, the space, and the refresh
//! token and the "remember this device" token of two-step login, both sealed by
//! the operating system for this user like the UwUSync pairing's secrets. The
//! master password and the keys above the space key are never kept.
