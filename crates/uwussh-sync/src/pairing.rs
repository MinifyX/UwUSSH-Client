//! Adding a device without typing a password into it.
//!
//! What a joining device needs is the account key, and the account key is the
//! one thing that must never go through the server. So the two devices agree
//! on a key of their own first — **SPAKE2**, where a short code spoken out loud
//! turns into a strong shared secret — and everything after that travels
//! sealed under it, through a server that carries it without understanding it.
//!
//! Why three words are enough where a three-word password would not be: SPAKE2
//! gives whoever does not know the code exactly **one** online guess. A wrong
//! guess leaves the two sides with different keys and nothing to show for it,
//! and the session is over.
//!
//! The order of the handshake matters, and it is not the obvious one:
//!
//! 1. Each side sends its SPAKE2 message.
//! 2. **The joining device proves it derived the same key** — before anything
//!    worth having is sent.
//! 3. Only then does the device that is already in hand over the account key,
//!    the fingerprint to pin and a one-time enrolment token.
//! 4. The joining device says who it is, so the other can show a name rather
//!    than "a device".
//!
//! Sending the secret first and asking questions later would hand it to the
//! one guess an attacker gets. This way that guess buys nothing.
