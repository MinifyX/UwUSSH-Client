//! A sync server in memory.
//!
//! This is the whole server, minus the network, the accounts and the disk: it
//! hands out sequence numbers, keeps the newest version of each record, pages
//! through them from a cursor, and refuses a write whose `base_seq` is not the
//! version it holds. Those are exactly the rules the real server must follow,
//! which is why they live here as running code rather than only in the
//! protocol's documentation — the tests in this crate hold two devices against
//! it, and the server's own tests can hold it against them.
//!
//! It also plays the part of a server that misbehaves: [`MemoryServer::store`]
//! writes a record the way a hostile or broken server would hand it back, so
//! the client's defences can be tested.
//!
//! And it keeps things back, which no seal catches:
//! [`MemoryServer::withhold`] leaves a record out of every pull, and
//! [`MemoryServer::serve_stale`] hands out an older version in place of the
//! newest — what the manifests are there to notice.
