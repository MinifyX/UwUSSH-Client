//! Offline-first sync.
//!
//! The rule that shapes this crate: **local writes never wait for the
//! network**. Every change lands in SQLite first and marks its row as waiting
//! in the same transaction; this crate is the background job that drains those
//! rows to a server and brings back what other devices wrote. If the server is
//! down, or you are on a train, nothing about using the app changes.
//!
//! What lives where:
//!
//! - [`uwussh_proto`] holds the wire format, the clock and the conflict rule —
//!   the three things client and server must agree on exactly.
//! - `uwussh_store` seals records on the way out, opens them on the way in,
//!   and decides per record who wins, inside the transaction that writes it.
//! - [`engine`] is one pass: pull, then push, then round again if the server
//!   reported a conflict.
//! - [`memory`] is the server's rules as running code, so two devices can be
//!   held against them without a network.
//!
//! - [`http`] is the real transport: one blocking request at a time, against a
//!   server whose certificate this device pinned ([`pin`]).
