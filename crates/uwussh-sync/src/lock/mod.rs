//! Syncing through a UwULock Server instead of UwUSync.
//!
//! What stays the same is everything that decides what is true: the records,
//! their clocks, the merge, the manifests, the seal. UwULock keeps UwUSync's
//! record model for its suite vault (`docs/uwu-api.md` §6 of UwULock-Server),
//! so the engine runs unchanged against [`Lock`] as its [`crate::Transport`].
//! What changes is the transport, the login and where the key comes from:
//!
//! | | UwUSync | UwULock |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Login | challenge signed by the device key | the account's email, master password and two-step login, as a Bitwarden client ([`sign_in`]) |
//! | Key | vault key wrapped by the Argon2 master key | the space key, under the account's extras key |
//! | Pull / push | `/v1/records` | `/uwu/v1/suite/spaces/ssh/records` |
//! | Live | polling | the realtime channel ([`live`]) |
//! | New device | pairing | signing in with the account |
//!
//! The space key is 32 bytes for XChaCha20-Poly1305, like the UwUSync vault
//! key, and the space id takes the vault id's place in every record's
//! associated data — so a space is simply this device's vault with another key
//! (`uwussh_store::lock`).
//!
//! And the move: [`moving`] copies an account from UwUSync to UwULock, checks
//! the copy, and only then does this device switch.
