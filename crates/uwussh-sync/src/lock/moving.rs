//! The one-click move from UwUSync to UwULock.
//!
//! Everything UwUSync holds is read, opened with the vault key this device
//! has, sealed again for the UwULock space — same id, kind, clock and
//! tombstone, a new nonce, the space's id and key — and pushed. Then the copy
//! is read back and held against what was read: only when every record is
//! there, at least as new, does the caller switch this device over. UwUSync
//! is only ever read from, so until then nothing has changed for it, and a
//! move that stops halfway leaves this device syncing as before.
//!
//! Running it again — after an interruption, or on the next device of the
//! same person — is safe and quick: what the space holds already at the same
//! version is not pushed again, and what another device moved or changed
//! since goes through the merge rule every sync uses.
//!
//! Manifests are not moved: they speak of one vault's devices, and each
//! device writes a fresh one for the space at its first sync there.
//!
//! What is kept while it runs is small and has a ceiling: of UwUSync's records
//! only the header and the opened payload, of the space's only the header.
//! Neither may come to more than a UwULock space holds ([`MAX_RECORDS`],
//! [`MAX_BYTES`]); a server that sends more stops the move instead of filling
//! this device's memory.
