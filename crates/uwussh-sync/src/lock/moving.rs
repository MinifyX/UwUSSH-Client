//! The one-click move from UwUSync to UwULock.
//!
//! Everything UwUSync holds is read, opened with the vault key this device
//! has, sealed again for the UwULock space — same id, kind, clock and
//! tombstone, a new nonce, the space's id and key — and pushed. Then the copy
//! is read back and held against what was read: only when every record is
//! there, at least as new, does the caller switch this device over. UwUSync is
//! only ever read from, so until then nothing has changed for it, and a move
//! that stops halfway leaves this device syncing as before.
//!
//! Running it again — after an interruption, or on the next device of the
//! same person — is safe and quick: what the space holds already at the same
//! version is not pushed again, and what another device moved or changed
//! since goes through the merge rule every sync uses.
//!
//! Manifests are not moved: they speak of one vault's devices, and each
//! device writes a fresh one for the space at its first sync there.
