//! One pass of syncing: hand the server what we have, then take what it has.
//!
//! Push first, pull second, and the second half is not optional even when
//! nothing came back: the cursor only moves on a pull, so a pass that ended
//! with a push would leave this device believing it had not seen its own
//! writes, and the next pass would download them. Pulling last also means the
//! records this device just pushed come back once and are checked against what
//! is here — cheap, and it catches a server that stored something else.
//!
//! A conflict therefore shows up on the way out, as a refusal carrying the
//! version the server holds. That version is merged straight away, and the
//! round starts over.
//!
//! A pass that got everything out and pulled to the end has one more thing to
//! do: publish this device's manifest if what it holds changed, and hold every
//! device's manifest against what is here — which is how a server that keeps
//! records back, or hands out old versions, is caught (see
//! `uwussh_store::manifest`).
//!
//! The pass is blocking and belongs on a thread of its own, not in the UI's
//! runtime: every step is either a database transaction or one request, and
//! neither wants to be interleaved with the terminal's data path.
